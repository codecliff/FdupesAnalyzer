# FdupesAnalyzer
An R utility to find level of overlap between directories from output of fdupes linux utility
https://github.com/codecliff/FdupesAnalyzer


## Why 
fdupes give you a file-by-file list of duplicates. It works very well with renamed copies and files exported by image editors and such. However, to clean up a large dump of files accumulated over years by muliple users, I needed to see thngs like ```70% of files in dir A are also in dir B```


### How To Use

* run fdupes and redirect results to file. 
  `fdupes -Sr rootpath >> fdupes_outpus.txt`
* Edit  R script FDupesParser.R , updae with above values of output file and rootpath. 
* Run R script (Preferably in interactive mode, preferably in  RStudio)
* Go over the csv file generated by script 

### Output file with these columns :
* "dir1"    : directory 1 
* "dir2"    : directory 2
* "matchcnt": no. of files matching betweent dir1 and dir2 
* "acnt"    : file count in dir1 
* "bcnt"    : file count in dir2 
* "aprct"   : percent of files in dir1 whch have copy in dir2
* "bprct"   : same for dir2 
* "maxprct" : max of above two 

### Prerequisites
* R
